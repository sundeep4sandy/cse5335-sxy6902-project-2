### What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?

- I choose postgresql as my database and used pgAdmin 4 as my database tool. I choose postgresql as I found the documentation of the database connections to be understandable which would help me in the database transactions in the project

### Aspects of implementation which were easy 

- Implementing the database connections as the documentation available for the database connection was very helpful.
- Implementation of the Rest api were easy as we have already implemented in the first project 

### Aspects of implementation which were hard

- Even though I've used angularjs in the first project I found the bonus score aninmation task to be the hardest as I was able to retrieve the data but not able to display it in the animation.
- The format of the data receieved is the format which I couldn't use so first I needed it to stringyfy and then again change it to JSON format

### If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?

- Since Angularjs is a new technology the clarity of the documentation is less than that of the other framework such as Jquery.
- In postgresql, effiency of the query is reduced as more and more connections and larger tables are introduced.
